# Battleship
Battleship Game

Developed 'BATTLESHIP' game in JAVA both in Command Line Interface and Graphical User Interface(Without any GUI Builder- Written each line of code myself). Developing it in a 'BITS' and 'PIECES' manner. Completed phase 1 which would have a single ship and just an interactive homepage apart from the main game. Currently working on the phase 2 which would add some sounds and graphics to the game and some cool and better interface including a menu and an option to select the ship design. New ideas or any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Update: Phase 2 partially completed
